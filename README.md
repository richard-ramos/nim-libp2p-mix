# libp2p_mix

Reference Nim implementation of the **LIBP2P-MIX** specification (LIP-99) — an
anonymous routing protocol for [nim-libp2p](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p)
based on the Sphinx packet format with Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs),
LIONESS payload encryption, cover traffic, and pluggable spam protection.

This package was extracted from `nim-libp2p`'s `libp2p/protocols/mix/` tree to
let mix evolve independently. Full extraction history is preserved — every
commit that ever touched mix retains its original author, date, and message,
with PR references rewritten to `vacp2p/nim-libp2p#NNNN` form so reviewers
can click through to the original threads.

## Specifications

This implementation tracks the following Logos LIPs published at
[lip.logos.co](https://lip.logos.co). The specs are the authoritative
reference for protocol behaviour, packet formats, and security properties —
code follows the spec, not the other way round.

## Installation

Add the dependency to your `.nimble` file:

```nim
requires "libp2p_mix"
```

Or pin a specific revision:

```nim
requires "https://github.com/logos-co/nim-libp2p-mix.git#<commit-or-tag>"
```

## Integration

Mounting mix on a libp2p switch:

```nim
import libp2p_mix
import libp2p_mix/mix_protocol
import libp2p_mix/mix_node

let mixNodeInfo = initMixNodeInfo(
  peerId, multiAddr, mixPubKey, mixPrivKey, libp2pPubKey, libp2pPrivKey
)

let mix = MixProtocol.new(mixNodeInfo, switch).valueOr:
  return err("mix init failed: " & error)

# Optional: configure how the exit layer reads payloads for a given proto
mix.registerDestReadBehavior("/your/proto/1.0.0", readLp(maxSize = -1))

# Optional: bootstrap the node pool
for bootstrapNode in bootstrapNodes:
  mix.nodePool.add(bootstrapNode)

# Mount and start
switch.mount(mix)
await mix.start()

# Open a mix-routed connection. `toConnection` does NOT send anything yet —
# it returns a libp2p `Connection` whose subsequent writes/reads are wrapped
# into Sphinx packets and routed through the mix overlay. Use it like any
# other libp2p connection.
let conn = mix.toConnection(
  MixDestination.init(targetPeerId, targetMultiAddr),
  proto = "/your/proto/1.0.0",
  MixParameters(expectReply: Opt.some(true), numSurbs: Opt.some(1.byte)),
).valueOr:
  return err(error)

# Now write/read as usual — the mix layer handles Sphinx wrapping, routing,
# and (when expectReply is set) collecting the response via SURBs.
await conn.writeLp(requestBytes)
let response = await conn.readLp(maxBytes)
```

For a complete worked example, see [`examples/mix_ping.nim`](examples/mix_ping.nim).

### Pluggable spam protection

Spam protection is a `SpamProtection` abstract base class
([`libp2p_mix/spam_protection`](libp2p_mix/spam_protection.nim)). Pass an
implementation at construction time:

```nim
let mix = MixProtocol.new(
  mixNodeInfo,
  switch,
  spamProtection = Opt.some(SpamProtection(myImpl)),
)
```

A reference RLN-based implementation lives in
[`mix-rln-spam-protection-plugin`](https://github.com/logos-co/mix-rln-spam-protection-plugin).

### Cover traffic & delay strategies

```nim
let ct = ConstantRateCoverTraffic.new(
  totalSlots = 10, epochDuration = 10.seconds, useInternalEpochTimer = true
)
let delay = DelayStrategy(
  ExponentialDelayStrategy.new(meanDelay = 100, rng = newRng())
)

let mix = MixProtocol.new(
  mixNodeInfo, switch,
  coverTraffic = Opt.some(CoverTraffic(ct)),
  delayStrategy = Opt.some(delay),
)
```

## Building & running

To set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logos-co/nim-libp2p-mix.git
cd nim-libp2p-mix
make setup        # generates nimble.paths
```

`make setup` runs `nimble setup -l` (`--localdeps`), which runs nimble in
project-local dependency mode and adds `--noNimblePath` to the generated
`nimble.paths`.

You can override the `NIMBLE_FLAGS` variable to pass extra flags to nimble:

```bash
make setup NIMBLE_FLAGS="-y"          # non-interactive
make setup NIMBLE_FLAGS=--solver:legacy # legacy solver
```

### Tests

```bash
nimble test            # 14 unit-test files (~143 individual checks)
nimble testComponent   # 6 component (integration) tests, ~26 checks
nimble testAll         # both
```

The `tests/config.nims` enables `-d:metrics` and several
`libp2p_*_metrics` defines so tests can assert on metric counters.

### Formatting

```bash
make format
```

`make format` runs `nph` over tracked Nim files. It assumes `nph` version
`0.7.0` is installed globally in the native shell, matching CI:

```bash
nimble -y install nph@0.7.0
```

Check the installed package version with `nimble dump nph` and look for
`version: "0.7.0"`. The `nph --version` output may still show a prerelease
string for this release, so prefer the Nimble package metadata.

### Example

```bash
nimble example
```

This compiles `examples/mix_ping.nim`, which spins up 10 mix nodes locally,
mounts the libp2p `Ping` protocol on a destination, sends a ping through the
mix network, and waits for the reply via SURBs. Expected output:

```
INF Ping response received through mix network rtt=41ms…
```

To build the binary without auto-cleanup:

```bash
nim c -d:libp2p_mix_experimental_exit_is_dest -d:metrics -o:mix_ping examples/mix_ping.nim
./mix_ping
```

### Cleaning

- `make clean` removes local generated artifacts: `nimble.lock`,
  `nimbledeps/`, and `nimble.paths`.
- `make clean-nimbledeps` only removes `nimbledeps/` and `nimble.paths`,
  leaving the Nix dependency lock untouched.
- `make refresh-deps` forces regeneration of the committed `nix/deps.nix`
  snapshot.

### Nix

A flake is provided for reproducible dev shells and builds.

```bash
nix develop          # drops you into a shell with nim 2.2 + nimble
nix build            # type-checks libp2p_mix.nim against locked deps
```

The flake reads `nix/deps.nix`, which is the **committed** snapshot of all
pinned transitive dependencies. Refresh it after bumping the libp2p pin in
`libp2p_mix.nimble`:

```bash
make deps   # regenerates nix/deps.nix
```

If you need to force regeneration from a clean intermediate lock file, run:

```bash
make refresh-deps
```

`NIMBLE_FLAGS` can be passed to `make refresh-deps` the same way as
`make setup`; command-line variables are forwarded to the recursive
`make deps` invocation:

```bash
make refresh-deps NIMBLE_FLAGS="-y --solver:legacy"
```

`NIMBLE_FLAGS` can also be passed to `make build` when dependency generation
may be triggered as part of the build:

```bash
make build NIMBLE_FLAGS="--solver:legacy"
```

For predictable forced regeneration, prefer `make refresh-deps`; `make build`
only uses `NIMBLE_FLAGS` if `nimble.lock` or `nix/deps.nix` need to be
regenerated.

If this does not work for any reason and you need to start fresh while in the Nix shell
(so after the initial `nix develop`), run:

```bash
make clean
make setup
make refresh-deps
nix build
```

optionally including `NIMBLE_FLAGS="--solver:legacy"` if necessary.

To quickly check that you are in the nix shell run:

```bash
echo "${IN_NIX_SHELL:-not in nix shell}"
```

`$IN_NIX_SHELL` is set by both `nix develop` and `nix-shell`. Typical
values: `impure` (default) or `pure` (when invoked with `--pure`). Any
non-empty value means you're inside a nix shell. Empty or unset means
you're not.

`make deps` requires `nix-prefetch-git` and `jq` on `$PATH`. Internally it
generates a fresh `nimble.lock`, forwards `NIMBLE_FLAGS` to `nimble lock`,
and then transforms the lock file via `tools/gen-deps.sh`.

`nimble.lock` itself is **not** committed — it's an intermediate build
artefact regenerated on demand (it lives in `.gitignore`). The long-lived
pinning artefact for this repo is `nix/deps.nix`. Downstream consumers
that need an exact dep set should pin libp2p_mix by URL+SHA in their own
`.nimble`. See logos-co/nim-libp2p-mix#13 for the discussion behind this.

## Compile-time flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-d:libp2p_mix_experimental_exit_is_dest` | Allow exit nodes to also be the message destination (waku/lightpush usage). Enabled by default in `libp2p_mix.nimble`. |
| `-d:metrics` | Enable Prometheus-style metric counters (test-time default). |
| `-d:enable_mix_benchmarks` | Compile in benchmark/timing helpers from `libp2p_mix/benchmark.nim`. |
